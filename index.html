    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned a lot so far.</p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>I've learned to manage code in repositories on GitHub. This allows me to be able to work on my projects anywhere. No more worries about losing a portable drive! </p>
    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>
        <p>I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to write HTML for structure not appearance. Some of the tags that I've learned include headings (&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;,etc.), paragraphs, and lists. I've also learned to use special entity characters. </p>
    <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
        <p>The things I like best about this class are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learning the structure of HTML.</li>
                <li>That HTML is like a pattern.</li>
                <li>I also like that once you start a tag, you have to make sure that you finish it. </li>
            </ol>
    <h3> Goals</h3>
        <p>I'm excited to learn more so that I can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eventually add some color on web pages.</li>
                <li>Soon be able to use different types of fonts. :)</li>
                <li>Add my own creative spin on websites with different pictures and links. </li>
            </ul>
